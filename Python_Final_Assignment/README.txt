 Program Description
 ------------------------
 The following program is a mock-up of a database management system (e.g username/password authentication)using SQLITE3.
 Upon starting the program, a database file will be created if it doesn't already exist, and the user will 
 be able to input commands that will interact with the database through supported features such as: 
	- User Sign In
	- Account Registration
	- Forgot Password/Password Reset
	- Account Deletion
	- Log-off 
 
 -------------------------
 How To Run
 -------------------------
 1. Open Command Prompt from the Start Menu > CMD
 2. Type in the following commands:
	cd <filepath of folder where the program resides> 
	database.py

 3. Follow the on-screen prompts.

 NOTES
 ----------------------------
 For convenience I have added an account to the DB already and the account information is as follows:
 
 Username: Username_One
 Password: Username_Password!1
 DOB: 01/01/0001
 
 Please feel free to use this account for testing or create your own account.
 You may delete "userbase.db" and the program will safely generate a new database, however the above account will no longer exist.
